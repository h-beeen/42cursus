## üí° About the project

> _The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line, read from a file descriptor._

	You will understand how files are opened, read and closed in an OS,
	and how they are interpreted by a programming language for further analysis.

	This task is crucial to understand for a future programmer 
	since much of the time is basedon manipulating files 
	for data management and persistence.

	This project consists of coding a function that returns one line at a time from a text file.

- For more detailed information, look at the [**subject of this project**](/get_next_line/get_next_line/README.md/).


## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

- The function is written in C language and thus needs the <br/> **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**‚ë† Using it in your code**

- To use the function in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
```

- And, when compiling your code, add the source files and the required flag:

```shell
$ get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -D BUFFER_SIZE=<size>
```

### Testing

- You only have to edit the get_next_line.c file and uncomment the main function and headers inside it. <br/>
You can edit test.txt files to put another text if you wish to test othe cases. <br/>
Then simply run this command (change "xx" with desired buffer size) :

```shell
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -D BUFFER_SIZE=xx get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c

$ ./a.out
```
